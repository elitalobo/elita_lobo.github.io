I am a Computer Science Ms/PhD student at University of Massachusetts Amherst. I am fortunate to be advised by Professor [Marek Petrik](https://marek.petrik.us/). I am interested in Reinforcement Learning, Optimizations, Machine Learning and in general everything Math! You can contact me by [email](loboelita@gmail.com).
